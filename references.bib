abstract = {MOTIVATION: Structure-conditioned information statistics have proven useful to predict
and visualize tRNA Class-Informative Features (CIFs) and their evolutionary divergences. Although
permutation p-values can quantify the significance of CIF divergences between two taxa, their naive
Monte Carlo approximation is slow and inaccurate. The Peaks-over-Threshold approach of Knijnenburg et
al. (2009) promises improvements to both speed and accuracy of permutation p-values, but has no
publicly available API.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We present tRNA Structure-Function Mapper (tSFM) v1.0, an open-
source, multi-threaded application that efficiently computes, visualizes, and assesses significance
of single- and paired-site CIFs and their evolutionary divergences for any RNA, protein, gene or
genomic element sequence family. multiple estimators of permutation p-values for CIF evolutionary
divergences are provided along with condidence intervals. tSFM is implemented in Python 3 with
compiled C extensions and is freely available through GitHub (https://github.com/tlawrence3/tSFM) and
PyPI.

abstract = {"Biostatistics: A Bayesian Introduction offers a pioneering approach by presenting the
foundations of biostatistics through the Bayesian lens. Using easily understood, classic Dutch Book
thought experiments to derive subjective probability from a simple principle of rationality, the book
connects statistical science with scientific reasoning. The author shows how to compute, interpret,
and report Bayesian statistical analyses in practice, and illustrates how to reinterpret traditional
statistical reporting - such as confidence intervals, margins of error, and one-sided p-values - in
Bayesian terms."},
